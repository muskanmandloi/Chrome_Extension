# Chrome_Extension
STEPS:
1. Create a manifest file. This file tells Chrome how to load and run your extension. It should include the following information:
The name of your extension
The version of your extension
The description of your extension
The icons for your extension
The permissions that your extension needs
2. Create an HTML file. This file will be the main content of your extension. It should include the following elements:
A toolbar button that users can click to open your extension
A popup window that displays the content of your extension
3. Create a CSS file. This file will style the elements in your HTML file.
4. Create a JavaScript file. This file will contain the code that powers your extension. It should include the following functions:
- A function that is called when the toolbar button is clicked
- A function that is called when the popup window is opened
- Once you have created these files, you can package them together into a Chrome extension. You can then install your extension on Chrome by clicking on the "Load unpacked extension" button in the Chrome extensions page.
